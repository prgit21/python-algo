1. Important conecepts and syntaxes to learn

    -Learn how to use name,*line
    -learn how to use score=list(map(float,line)
    -Never use loops to manip number,just use inbuilt


2. Calculate diagnals of matrix
       -2 loops for i & j termintate with n 
       -if (i == J):
            principal diagnol
        -if (i = n-j-1):
            reverse diagnol
